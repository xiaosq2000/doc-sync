A code change does not tell you which documents it made wrong. Docstale lists
every document whose source files changed since someone last reviewed it.

![An agent renames connect() to open() in src/client.py. README.md still says connect(), so the docstale Stop hook reports README.md with the changed source. A reviewer subagent finds the Usage section affected, the agent updates README.md, and docstale stamp records the review in docstale.lock.](docs/assets/agent-session.svg)

## How it works

- You list the source files that each document describes in `docstale.toml`.
- After you review a document, `docstale stamp` records its sources in
  `docstale.lock`.
- `docstale check` lists each document whose sources changed since its stamp.

Docstale compares Git object ids. It does not call an LLM or guess what a change
means. You commit the lock, so your agent, pre-commit, CI, and teammates all get
the same answer.

## Quick start

You need Python 3.11 or newer and Git.

1. Install docstale:

   ```bash
   uv tool install git+https://github.com/xiaosq2000/docstale.git
   ```

2. Create `docstale.toml` at the repository root. Each line maps a document to
   the files it describes:

   ```toml
   [documents]
   "README.md" = ["src/", "pyproject.toml"]
   "docs/api.md" = ["src/api/"]
   ```

3. Check that these documents are accurate today, then stamp them and commit the
   lock:

   ```bash
   docstale stamp --all
   git add docstale.toml docstale.lock
   ```

4. After you change code, run the check:

   ```bash
   docstale check
   ```

   Its output starts with each document to review and the sources that changed:

   ```text
   Documentation needs review.

   README.md (changed since 9c1b2e7d41f0)
     src/client.py
   ```

5. Read the document, fix it if needed, and stamp it. Stamp it even when nothing
   needed fixing:

   ```bash
   docstale stamp README.md
   ```

Editing a document does not count as a review. Only `docstale stamp` clears it.

## Remind your coding agent

Claude Code, Codex, and pi can run docstale when a session starts and before the
agent finishes a request. If sources change during the session, docstale asks the
agent to review the affected documents.

### Claude Code and Codex

1. Add these hooks to `.claude/settings.json` or `.codex/hooks.json`. Keep the
   settings that are already in the file:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "SessionStart": [
         {
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "docstale hook",
               "timeout": 30
             }
           ]
         }
       ],
       "Stop": [
         {
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "docstale hook",
               "timeout": 30,
               "statusMessage": "Checking documentation impact..."
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. In Codex, open `/hooks` and trust the new entry.

3. Optional: add the reviewer subagent for your coding agent. It reads the diff
   and the document, and answers `unaffected`, `affected`, or `unsure`. It never
   edits or stamps files.

   For Claude Code:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/agents
   curl -o .claude/agents/docstale-reviewer.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaosq2000/docstale/main/.claude/agents/docstale-reviewer.md
   ```

   For Codex, use a version that supports native `.codex/agents/*.toml` files:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .codex/agents
   curl -o .codex/agents/docstale-reviewer.toml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaosq2000/docstale/main/.codex/agents/docstale-reviewer.toml
   ```

   To choose another model, edit `model` in the reviewer file. The Claude Code
   default is `haiku`. The Codex defaults are:

   ```toml
   model = "gpt-6-luna"
   model_reasoning_effort = "high"
   ```

   In Codex, set both values to ones your model and account support. Restart
   Codex after adding or changing the definition. These settings affect only
   the reviewer, not the main agent or other subagents.

### Pi

Pi uses an extension instead of JSON hooks. You need pi 1.0.2 or newer and the
`docstale` command from the quick start.

1. Install the extension:

   ```bash
   pi install git:github.com/xiaosq2000/docstale
   ```

   Add `--local` to install it for one project instead of every project.

2. Start a new pi session. Alternatively, run `/reload` in the current session.

The extension saves a session baseline and checks before pi finishes a request.
If a document needs review, it sends the reminder to the model and requests one
continuation. It does not start a reviewer subagent or stamp documents.

The extension runs `docstale` from `PATH`. If needed, set `DOCSTALE_EXECUTABLE`
to the executable's full path before starting pi. The value is one executable
path, not a shell command.

To pause any agent hook in one checkout, run `docstale disable`. Run
`docstale enable` to enable the hooks again. Manual checks still run.

## Block commits and pull requests

To block a commit while a document needs review, add the pre-commit hook:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/xiaosq2000/docstale
    rev: <commit>
    hooks:
      - id: docstale
```

Stage `docstale.lock` with the rest of the commit.

To fail CI instead, add this step after the checkout:

```yaml
- uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
- run: uvx --from git+https://github.com/xiaosq2000/docstale.git docstale check
```

`docstale check` exits `0` when no document needs review, `2` when one does, and
`1` when the configuration or Git fails.
